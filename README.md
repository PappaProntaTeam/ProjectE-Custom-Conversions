# ProjectE-Custom-Conversions
Custom conversion values I've typed out for ProjectE.

Currently done:
ExtraCells, Mekanism(must use ProjectE's NBT branch. Must also disble dust blacklisting in the Mapper.cfg file.)

Installation: Just stick JSON files in your config/ProjectE/customConversions folder.

Want other mods? Ask and I'll do them if I have time.
